# I dont have twiter so I could not take a tweet.
tweet = "ggggggggIIIIggggIIIIgggggggg" # this is the string
print(tweet) # simply printing it.
print("\n")
print("\t" + tweet.lstrip("g")) # printing it removing all the left "g"s and a tab at the begining
print(tweet.rstrip("g") + "\n") # printing tweet removing all the right "g"s and adding a new line after that
print("\t" + tweet.strip("g")) # printing it removing the "g"s on both sides but keeping the "g"s in the middle.
